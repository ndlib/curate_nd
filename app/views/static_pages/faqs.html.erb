    <dl>
      <dt>What is CurateND?</dt>
      <dd>
        CurateND is the institutional repository for the University of Notre Dame.
        It is for preserving and providing access to scholarship (e.g. articles, manuscripts, research data), pedagogical materials, and other
        scholarly material the university has acquired (e.g. digitization of rare books, and the back catalog of the Notre Dame Press).
        One of the largest collections is the <a href="/catalog?f_inclusive[human_readable_type_sim][]=Doctoral+Dissertation&f_inclusive[human_readable_type_sim][]=Master's+Thesis">Electronic Dissertations and Theses</a> since 2005.
      </dd>

      <dt>How can CurateND help me?</dt>
      <dd>
      CurateND helps researchers by providing a place to deposit data, articles, and notes.
      This lets you make your scholarship available to others without needing to put it on your own website.
      The links will not break and the content will be available and preserved even after you leave the University.
      CurateND can provide a DOI, allowing you to cite these items in published scholarship.
      For example, you can deposit your dataset and then cite it using the DOI that CurateND creates.
      </dd>

      <dt>Who may use CurateND?</dt>
      <dd>
        Anyone in the world may access the public content in CurateND.
        People with a valid NetID may log in to deposit items and to view files marked as &ldquo;Notre Dame Only&rdquo;.
      </dd>

      <dt>Do I need a special account to log in to CurateND?</dt>
      <dd>
      CurateND uses the central university login service, so you can log in using the same NetID and password
      used for other campus services, such as email.
      </dd>

      <dt>Can people unaffiliated with Notre Dame deposit works?</dt>
      <dd>Only people with a valid NetID can can deposit items.
      If you do not have a valid NetID and the items you would like to deposit were done either with a project affiliated with Notre Dame,
      or while you yourself were at Notre Dame, please <%= contact_curatend_support %> about the possibility of deposit.
      </dd>

      <dt>Do people who leave or graduate from Notre Dame still have access to CurateND?</dt>
      <dd>
        People who leave or graduate from Notre Dame can only upload files or view private items until their university NetID is deactivated,
        which usually happens a few months after leaving.
        After that, they can still search and view the public content in CurateND.
      </dd>

      <dt>Is CurateND indexed by search engines?</dt>
      <dd>
        CurateND is indexed by all major search engines.
      </dd>

      <dt>Will items I deposit appear in the <a href="https://library.nd.edu/">Library Catalog</a>?</dt>
      <dd>
      Some items, such as dissertations, are added to the library catalog.
      Other items, such as publications, are in the catalog because publishers have already provided records for them.
      In that case, if a copy of the article is available publicly in CurateND, then it will be
      linked to from the library catalog page for the article.
      Otherwise, items in CurateND are not automatically added to the library catalog at the moment.
      </dd>

      <dt>What is a DOI?</dt>
      <dd>
      A DOI is an <a href="https://www.doi.org/">international standard (ISO 26324)</a> for identifying electronic documents, such as journal articles or datasets.
      It is widely used for academic citations since they are designed to persist over the long term.
      CurateND can either record the DOI of items that already have one (i.e. published articles), or it can assign one upon request.
      </dd>

      <dt>What are persistent URLs?</dt>
      <dd>
        A persistent URL (PURL) is a URL that does not break.
        It is expected to work and return documents from CurateND for a long time, where a &ldquo;long time&rdquo; is more than ten years.
        On CurateND, the URLs in the form <tt>https://curate.nd.edu/show/XXXXX</tt> and <tt>https://curate.nd.edu/download/XXXXX</tt>, where <tt>XXXXX</tt> is an
        11 character identifier, are considered PURLs, and will be preserved even as the rest of the website evolves.
      </dd>

      <dt>Do I relinquish my rights to my work by depositing it?</dt>
      <dd>
        No. You keep all your rights.
      </dd>

      <dt>What is a Creative Commons license?</dt>
      <dd>
        A Creative Commons license is one of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">set of licenses</a> providing others various degrees of permission for use.
        Some of these permissions require attribution, allow for commercial use and re-use, or permit others to make derivative works.
      </dd>

      <dt>What other licensing options are available?</dt>

        </p>

      <dt>How do I deposit a dissertation?</dt>
      <dd>

      </dd>

      <dt>How do I deposit a large number of collections or files?</dt>
      <dd>
        If you have a large number of files&mdash;more than a dozen or so&mdash;please <%= contact_curatend_support %>, and we can work with you directly.
        We have tools to organize and upload large groups of files.
      </dd>

      <dt>How do I find items I have previously deposited?</dt>
      <dd>
        Try searching for your work from inside CurateND itself.
        If any items are not public you will need to log in to see them in the search results.
      </dd>

      <dt>What does preservation mean? Can anyone edit the documents I deposit?</dt>
      <dd>
        Preservation means we are concerned about keeping your files intact in perpetuity.
        To do this we keep many copies of your files, and we verify that they do not change over time.
        If a copy should have an error or disappear, we will replace it using another copy.
        We also pay attention to obsolete file formats (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar">WordStar</a>), and try to migrate your files into more modern formats.
        And we never edit your submitted files.
      </dd>

      <dt>Is there a content review? Is there a concern that there will be a lot of junk data submitted?</dt>
      <dd>
        Yes, there is a review process.
        Content that is deposited into CurateND is examined for various characteristics such as completeness and academic integrity.
      </dd>

      <dt>How can I keep a work private, but still allow collaborators unaffiliated with the university to view it?</dt>
      <dd>
        External collaborators can only view public content in the repository.
        If you are actively working with collaborators from different institutions, take a look at the <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Can one search by academic department?</dt>
      <dd>
        <a href="/departments">Yes</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt>What is the difference between an article and a document?</dt>
      <dd>
        An article is a specific type of document.
        Other types of documents may include a poster, an image, a spreadsheet, etc.
      </dd>

      <dt>Is there a work type for unpublished materials?</dt>
      <dd>
        No, items in the repository are centered around specific formats such as articles, books, data sets, collections, etc.
        Pick the format that most closely matches your unpublished materials when depositing them.
      </dd>

      <dt>Is research done at the university property of the university or researcher?</dt>
      <dd>
        It depends on the exact nature of your work and the kinds of items in your research output (e.g. articles, software, data sets).

        See <a href="http://policy.nd.edu/assets/203012/intellectualpropertypolicy.pdf">University Policy on Intellectual Property</a> for guidance.
        Section 2.2 may be the most useful:

        The University owns all copyrightable materials (including computer programs, software, or
multi-media productions) that are works made for hire under copyright law or that are
developed pursuant to University Work unless otherwise provided in this policy. Consistent
with long-standing academic tradition, the University does not normally claim ownership of
works such as textbooks, articles, papers, scholarly monographs, or artistic works. Creators
therefore retain copyright in such works, unless such works are created under a grant or
sponsored program that specifies ownership rights in some entity other than the Creator, such
works are the subject of a contract modifying ownership rights, or rights in such works are
otherwise addressed in this policy.
